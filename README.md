# spotted-checker
Practical assignment for Advances in Model Checking: LTL based model checker using the SPOT platform. 
Explores the tools in the Spot library to perform various model checking task:
- Building Kripke Structures
- Reading LTL formulas
- Building Buchi automata
- Computing cross products of Kripke and Buchi

Also provides an abstraction layer for defining Kripke structures and Buchi automata, making it more approachable and requiring less foreknowledge of C++ and Spot.

Contains an example implementation of Peterson's algorithm for N processes and some properties to check.
